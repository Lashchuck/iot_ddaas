IoT DDAAS (Data Detection and Analysis System of IoT Devices)

Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a system for detecting and analyzing anomalies in data collected from IoT devices. The system gathers data from microcontrollers (ESP32 - 2 soil moisture sensors, ESP8266 - temperature sensor), analyzes it in real-time, identifies anomalies, and generates reports and notifications. Project is useful for detecting irregularities such as device malfunctions, environmental changes, or suspicious activity, making it ideal for monitoring IoT infrastructures.
